== Generic Distribute Application - Example with Todos, but not mandatory

* Use a simple CRUD OpenAPI Spec
* Complex exchange objects not necassary

* Expose REST API following the idea of Richardson's maturity
* Follow the 12-factor principles
  * External Configuration: Ports, DB Connection, Backend Connection, ...
  * Attach backend services (Postgres, Mongo, Kafka, ...)

* Documentation is nice. If generated by ChatGPT it is still nice :)

=== API Side - hopefully full CRUD:

Base URL: /todos/

----
GET /todos/ (returns a list of todos)
GET /todos/{name} (returns a todo if exists)
POST /todos/ (send/receive JSON object)
DELETE  /todos/{name} (deletes a todo if exists)
PUT /todos/ (send/receive JSON object., e.g. can change priority)
----

=== Backend side:
* Provide the REST API implementation (if possible with some form of documenation)
* Provide a persistence mechanism (persist Todos in a database)
* Provide a database (or something else)
* Provide a docker build mechanism (docker-compose for application and database)
* Indicate where the exposed port is configured

Language/Framework recommendations: Java/Kotlin(Spring Boot, Micronaut, Quarkus), Python, .net, Go, node.js, C 

=== Frontend side:
* Implement a REST Client to talk to the REST API of the backend
* Render functionality in a (web) UI
* Indicate how to configure the backend URL

Language/Framework recommendations: Vue, Angular, React, PHP ...

Potential options for groups with 3 people:
* Provide an example with different protocols, e.g. REST and GraphQL
* Implement authentication and multi-tenency (todos per user)
